Project 3: Fraud Detection  
Description:  Developed a machine learning pipeline for fraud detection in financial transactions. The objective  
was to build a model that could automatically identify fraudulent transactions based on various features and 
patterns in the transaction data.      
Responsibilities:  
• Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and identify 
potential patterns related to fraudulent transactions.   
• Engineered features by creating new variables, aggregating transaction data, and encoding categorical 
variables to improve the model's ability to detect fraud.   
• Implemented an ensemble learni ng approach, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, to combine 
multiple machine learning models and improve fraud detection accuracy.
